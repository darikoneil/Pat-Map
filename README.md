### PatMap: Identifying Pattern Completion Neurons in Neuronal Ensembles
Darik A. O'Neil, Alejandro Akrouh, & Rafael Yuste.

PatMap contains code and a simple graphical user interface for detecting pattern completion neurons using the approach utilized in [Identification of Pattern Completion Neurons in Neuronal Ensembles Using Probabilistic Graphical Models](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/41/41/8577) and as decribed in the associated publication [Mapping Neuronal Ensembles and Pattern Completion Neurons through Graphical Models]()

'modified, must use this repo as source

### **Installation**
**Windows**: No installation is required.      

**Ubuntu >= 20.04 LTS**:      
Set the system path for libgfortran3 in your system's terminal before starting matlab:      
`export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/{your_patmap_path_here}/src/third_party/fortran_support_modern_ubuntu/libgfortran.so.3`

**Ubuntu <= 20.04 LTS**:
Install libgfortran3 if not already present:
`sudo apt-get install libgfortran3`

**Compiling from Source**: To compile the mex functions from source (e.g., if you corrupt the compiled files or run into segmentation faults), enter the path to your MATLAB mex file in the Makefile. Then enter the repository's directory and enter `make` in your operating system's terminal.


### Using the GUI     
#### Launching GUI
```app = pat_map();```

#### Hotkeys
* 'right arrow' - next UDF
* 'left arrow' - previous UDF
* 'up arrow' - highlight next node
* 'down arrow' - highlight previous node
* 's' - save
